# Summary

This project contains the statistical analysis steps executed for my Master Thesis. It does not contain preprocessing scripts as these were not solely done by myself and I do not have permission to upload them here.

The python scripts contain: 
1. General data handling/transformation from raw .fif to csv data.
2. SNR analysis
3. Plotting of respective data.

The R scripts contain: 
1. ERP analysis
2. LMM's of the main effects and pairwise comparisons.
3. Plotting of respective data.

If somebody finds interest/would like to use this code - do it, I dont care.
